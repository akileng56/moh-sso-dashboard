# Cross-Application SSO

The Integrated Health Portal uses Keycloak for identity and a backend-managed `sso_session` cookie for its application session. Opening `/portal/` directly is intentionally public and does not create that backend session.

## Production Route Ownership

`dashboards.health.go.ug` is a shared origin. Report Browser owns the origin root;
the Integrated Health Portal does not:

| URL path | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Report Browser |
| `/report-browser` and `/report-browser/*` | Report Browser |
| `/portal` and `/portal/*` | Integrated Health Portal frontend |
| `/ssobackend` and `/ssobackend/*` | Integrated Health Portal backend |

Consequently, `https://dashboards.health.go.ug/` and
`https://dashboards.health.go.ug/report-browser` both opening Report Browser is
expected. Portal links must begin with `/portal`. Portal authentication links must
begin with `/ssobackend` after runtime resolution.

## Launch Contract

Applications that launch the portal and need an authenticated destination must use the registry's `authenticatedLaunchUrl`:

```text
/api/v1/auth/launch?returnTo=/portal/apps/news
```

The ordinary `launchUrl` remains `/portal`. The launcher resolves the authenticated backend path against its runtime API base. In production, an API base of `https://dashboards.health.go.ug/ssobackend` therefore produces:

```text
https://dashboards.health.go.ug/ssobackend/api/v1/auth/launch?returnTo=%2Fportal%2Fapps%2Fnews
```

The backend redirects to Keycloak. An existing Keycloak SSO session is reused, the fixed callback creates the portal `sso_session`, and the browser returns to the validated portal route. Tokens, authorization codes, and session identifiers are never added to launcher URLs.

An external launcher must not navigate directly to the registry value
`/api/v1/auth/launch?...` on the shared production origin. Doing that requests
`https://dashboards.health.go.ug/api/v1/...`, which belongs to neither portal route.
It must resolve the value against the portal API base first, producing the
`/ssobackend/api/v1/...` URL shown above.

## Registry Metadata

The `dashboard-web` system should define:

```yaml
launchUrl: /portal
authenticatedLaunchUrl: /api/v1/auth/launch?returnTo=%2Fportal%2Fapps%2Fnews
```

The equivalent Keycloak client attributes are `ui.launchUrl` and `ui.authenticatedLaunchUrl`. Portal administrators can edit both values through Systems or RBAC Management. Report Browser and other external launchers should consume this metadata instead of hardcoding `/portal/`.

## Redirect Security

`returnTo` accepts `/portal` paths and optional query strings or fragments. Absolute URLs require an exact origin in `AUTH_RETURN_URL_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. The backend rejects foreign origins, credentials, unsupported schemes, scheme-relative URLs, control characters, encoded separators, double encoding, and dot-segment traversal. The target is bound to OAuth state in a short-lived HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookie and is cleared after success or terminal failure.

HTTP `Referer` is never used as a redirect target.

## Environment Configuration

Development:

```env
FRONTEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/portal
AUTH_RETURN_URL_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
KEYCLOAK_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:9000/api/v1/auth/callback
```

Production:

```env
FRONTEND_BASE_URL=https://dashboards.health.go.ug/portal
AUTH_RETURN_URL_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://dashboards.health.go.ug
KEYCLOAK_REDIRECT_URI=https://dashboards.health.go.ug/ssobackend/api/v1/auth/callback
API_BASE_URL=/ssobackend
```

The portal and the launching application must use the same Keycloak realm and browser-visible Keycloak origin. Configure only the exact callback URI. Avoid broad redirect wildcards.

## Verification

1. Sign into Report Browser through Keycloak.
2. Launch Integrated Health Portal using `authenticatedLaunchUrl`.
3. Confirm Keycloak does not ask for credentials again.
4. Confirm the browser arrives at `/portal/apps/news`.
5. Confirm `/ssobackend/api/v1/auth/me` returns the authenticated user.
6. Confirm portal menus reflect that user's effective RBAC permissions.

If the public News page appears unauthenticated, inspect the launcher URL first. A direct `/portal/` link bypasses portal session creation by design.

If the browser returns to Report Browser instead, inspect the final path. `/` and
`/report-browser` intentionally belong to Report Browser; only `/portal/*` is a portal
frontend destination.
